Before it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the Sultanate of Sokoto which also included much of northern Cameroon. The rulers bear the title of emir ("lamido" in the local language, Fulfulde).
The name "Adamawa" came from the founder of the kingdom, Modibo Adama, a regional leader of the Fulani Jihad organized by Usman dan Fodio of Sokoto in 1804. Modibo Adama came from the region of Gurin (now just a small village) and in 1806, received a green flag for leading the jihad in his native country. In the following years, Adama conquered many lands and tribes. In 1838, he moved his capital to Ribadu, and in 1839, to Joboliwo. In 1841, he founded Yola, where he died in 1848. After the European colonization (first by Germany and then by Britain), the rulers remained as emirs and the line of succession has continued to the present day.
Emirs of Adamawa have included:
    Modibbo Adama ben Hassan, 1809–1848
    Lawalu ben Adama, 1848–1872 (son of the previous)
    Sanda ben Adama, 1872–1890 (brother of the previous)
    Zubayru ben Adama, 1890–1901 (brother of the previous)
    Bobbo Ahmadu ben Adama, 1901–1909 (brother of the previous)
    Iya ben Sanda, 1909–1910 (son of Sanda ben Adama)
    Muhammadu Abba, 1910–1924 (son of Bobbo Ahmadu ben Adama)
    Muhammadu Bello ben Ahmadu ben Hamidu ben Adamu, 1924–1928
    Mustafa ben Muhammadu Abba, 1928–1946 (son of Muhammadu Abba)
    Ahmadu ben Muhammadu Bello, 1946–1953
    Aliyu Mustafa, 1953–2010
    Muhammadu Barkindo Aliyu Musdafa, 2011–present
Impact of Islamist insurgency
Adamawa State has been impacted by the Islamist insurgency in Nigeria. As of November 30, 2014, the state has become home to camps housing an estimated 35,000 internally displaced persons fleeing violence from Boko Haram in locations such as Mubi, Madagali, Askira Uba, Bama and Gwoza in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe. Another 100,000 internally displaced persons are estimated to be living in households outside the camps and with friends or relatives. Some Nigerians who had earlier fled to Cameroon have now been restored back to their country. Yet, another estimate placed the number of internally displaced persons around Yola at 400,000. Organizations serving the community include the Adamawa Peace Initiative (API)- a group of business, religious, and community leaders- and the Adamawa Muslim Council. The United States Agency for International Development has pledged to provide continuing humanitarian assistance.
