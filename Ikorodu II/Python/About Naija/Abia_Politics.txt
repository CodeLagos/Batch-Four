In 1999, Nigeria became a democracy and Orji Uzor Kalu contested on the platform of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and won the Governorship election in Abia State. Consequently, he was sworn-in on 29th of May, 1999. In 2003, when it was time for fresh elections, Kalu re-contested on the platform of the PDP and got a second mandate to govern (The Constitution of Nigeria limits Governors to two terms in office). Theodore Orji (PPA) defeated Onyema Ugochukwu (PDP) in the 2007 general elections to become Abia's next Governor. In 2011, Theodore Orji decamped from PPA to the PDP and was re-elected for another four-year tenure.
On 11 April, 2015, Okezie Ikpeazu was voted as the ninth Governor of Abia State under the platform of the People's Democratic Party.
