Lagos Trip Curator - Python Functionalities by: Tolulope Odueke (tolulope.od@gmail.com)
A CodeLagos Project handled by Mr. Dotun Onasanya - CodeLagos Facilitator MusterPoint, Ogba, Lagos.
CodeLagos August - September, 2018.

This project was carried out to display some capabilities of Python for Information Gathering and the creation of information systems based on web crawling.

The program serves as an information system/vacation guide to represent the state of Lagos and provide some information to influence would-be tourists or visitors to the state.

It starts out by requesting the users name and then returns a weather forecast for the next 10 days via the Yahoo weather API for Python (this can be found in the PyPI). The weather forecast prepares the intending user for the type of conditions to expect on arrival in Lagos.

After that, it asks for a trip budget as would be required if one is making a journey, be it business or pleasure (in future updates, this budget would influence results returned to the user to help effectively plan).

The program also requests to know the primary means of transport(more functionality could also be added to this in future commits). 

One of the major parts of this program is the information system. It contains information about certain areas in Lagos state as well as activities that might be associated with them. It also returns a list of hotels in those areas, along with their respective prices, this was done through a web scraper that scrapes the hotels.ng website(one of the leading hotel web management services in Nigeria)....

The aim of this program is to provide information to the user, about Lagos and her environs and all of the great things that can be found/expected on visiting the state for the first time.

After the program terminates, it send a summary based on the decisions/options chosen during the running of the program which is stored in the output.txt file. Upon the termination of the program, the user can refer to this file for more information or as a reference of the trip plan.

This  project was done by Tolulope Odueke, as a pre-requisite for the completion for the Python Development class by CodeLagos for August - September 2018.
I would also love to seize this opportunity to thank the Government of Lagos state and the state Governor, His Excellency Governor Ambode for the opportunity given to lagosians to learn to code to bring solutions to our neighbourhood. 
Thank you for sharing in the Lagos Experience, I have I have been able to provide you with some useful information enough to influence your stay in the Centre of Excellence.
